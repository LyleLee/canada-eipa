            in Council, on the basis of a report under the `Canadian
            International Trade Tribunal Act </eng/acts/C-18.3>`__, that

            injury to domestic producers of like or directly competitive
            goods.

            `Canadian International Trade Tribunal
            Act </eng/acts/C-18.3>`__, that
